# How to use Transcripto
![screenshot-2](/assets/screenshot-2.png)
Transcripto has two modes of operation.

**In both modes, transcript will be automatically downloaded as a text file at the end of each meeting.**

- **Auto mode:** Automatically records transcripts for all meetings
- **Manual mode:** Switch on Transcripto by clicking on captions icon in Google Meet (CC icon)


> **Avoid closing the meeting tab to end the call.** If you do it by mistake, you can still download the last meeting transcript by opening the extension. This will be overwritten when a new meeting starts.
